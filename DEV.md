# Developer Information

## Architecture

- **Server:** Rust with [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/) SSR and
  [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum)
- **Client:** WASM via Leptos hydration
- **Database:** SQLite via [Diesel](https://diesel.rs/) ORM
- **Real-time:** WebSocket with JSON messages (snapshot + event model)
- **Auth:** JWT tokens in HttpOnly cookies, Argon2 password hashing

The project uses `ssr` and `hydrate` feature flags. `cargo-leptos` builds the
server binary with `--features ssr` and the WASM client with
`--features hydrate --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`. Server-only code (auth,
database, WebSocket handler) is gated behind `#[cfg(feature = "ssr")]`. Shared
types (DTOs, WebSocket message enums) compile for both targets. Server functions
use Leptos `#[server]` which generates client-side RPC stubs automatically.

## Build Prerequisites

For general development:

  - Rust (stable, 1.85+)
  - SQLite3 development libraries (e.g. `libsqlite3-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu)
    ```bash
    sudo apt install libsqlite3-dev
    ```
  - install tools needed for static linking:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install musl-tools
    rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
    ```
  - Add `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
  - Install cargo leptos: `cargo install cargo-leptos`
  - Install Diesel CLI tools: `cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features sqlite`

### For AI (Claude, Gemini, etc) and MCP tools

Commands to check and install requirements (idempotent)

Debian/ubuntu commands: #TODO: setup environment: "WEBDRIVER_PREFERRED_DRIVER": "chrome", "WEBDRIVER_HEADLESS": "true"
  ```bash
  geckodriver --version || sudo apt install firefox                   # Install Firefox (for geckodriver)
  chromedriver --version || sudo apt install chromium-chromedriver    # Install Chromium's chromedriver

  cd rust-browser-mcp
  cargo build --release
  # add the MCP to the config
  claude mcp add rust-browser-mcp -- rust-browser-mcp --transport stdio
  ```

## Testing

```sh
cargo test --features ssr
```

Unit tests are co-located in their source files using `#[cfg(test)]` modules.
Current test coverage includes:

- **`auth.rs`** — JWT claims subject parsing (`parse_claims_sub`)
- **`components/initiative.rs`** — drag-and-drop reorder index calculation (`reorder_index`)

See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for planned additional tests.

### Supported Platforms

  * [Firefox 115.32.0 ESR](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/115.32.0esr/)
  * Chrome 138.0 (LTS-138) [Long Term Support](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/11333726)

## Design Details

### Pages

- **Landing page** — introduction to the site with links to log in or sign up.
- **Login page** — handles user authentication via JWT. Supports login and signup with a toggle.
- **Sessions page** — lists active game sessions; lets users create or join sessions.
- **Game page** — main game view with map, chat, initiative tracker, inventory, character sheets, and creature stat blocks.

### Authentication

JWT tokens are stored in HttpOnly cookies set by the login/signup server
functions. The `get_current_user` server function extracts and validates the
token from the cookie header. WebSocket connections authenticate via a `token`
query parameter.

The login page requires HTTPS. This is enforced in two ways depending on
deployment:

- **Built-in TLS:** Set `TLS_CERT_PATH` and `TLS_KEY_PATH` env vars. The
  server runs HTTPS on port 3443 (or `TLS_PORT`) and an HTTP redirect server
  on the normal port that sends all traffic to HTTPS.
- **Reverse proxy:** When behind a proxy that sets `X-Forwarded-Proto`, the
  server redirects `/login` requests that arrive over plain HTTP to HTTPS.
- **Development:** With no TLS config and no proxy headers, the server runs
  plain HTTP with no redirects.

### HTTPS / TLS Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TLS_CERT_PATH` | (none) | Path to PEM certificate file. Enables built-in TLS when set with `TLS_KEY_PATH`. |
| `TLS_KEY_PATH` | (none) | Path to PEM private key file. |
| `TLS_PORT` | `3443` | Port for the HTTPS listener. |

To generate a self-signed certificate for development:

```sh
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem \
  -days 365 -nodes -subj '/CN=localhost'
```

Then run with:

```sh
TLS_CERT_PATH=cert.pem TLS_KEY_PATH=key.pem cargo leptos serve
```

### WebSocket Protocol

On connect, the client calls the `get_ws_token` server function to obtain the
JWT token, then opens a WebSocket to `/api/ws?token=<jwt>`. It sends a `JoinSession`
message and receives a `SessionJoined` response with a full `GameStateSnapshot`.
After that, incremental events are broadcast to all connected clients. The server
is the single source of truth — clients send requests, the server validates and
broadcasts results.

All message types are fully implemented:

- **Chat:** messages and dice rolls (`NdN+M` notation, rolled server-side)
- **Tokens:** place, move, remove, HP updates (creature-linked tokens auto-init HP)
- **Fog of war:** reveal/hide cells (GM only)
- **Map:** switch active map (GM only)
- **Initiative:** add/remove entries, advance turn (GM only), roll initiative
  from character sheet or creature panel, lock/unlock initiative rolls
- **Character sheets:** update fields via dot-path (e.g. `stats.strength`),
  real-time resource updates via `CharacterResourceUpdated`
- **Inventory:** add, remove, update items

GM role is enforced server-side for token placement/removal, fog, map,
initiative list updates, and initiative lock/unlock.

### Game Page Architecture

The game page (`pages/game.rs`) creates a `GameContext` provided via Leptos
context to all child components. `GameContext` holds `RwSignal`s for each piece
of game state (map, tokens, fog, chat, initiative, inventory) plus:

- `character_revision: RwSignal<u32>` — bumped on any character data/resource
  change; listeners (e.g. character selection list) track this to trigger
  refetches.
- `initiative_locked: RwSignal<bool>` — whether character sheet initiative
  rolls are locked (GM toggle).
- `loading_status` / `loading_error: RwSignal<Option<String>>` — startup
  modal state.
- `send: StoredValue<Option<SendFn>, LocalStorage>` — WebSocket send
  function (non-`Send` JS type, stored with `LocalStorage`).

Components read state reactively and send messages through the context:

- **MapCanvas** — HTML5 Canvas rendering with grid, tokens (colored circles or
  images clipped to circles), HP bars, fog of war overlay. Supports background
  images and token images loaded from the media system. Drag-and-drop token
  movement. GM can set map background via the media browser.
- **ChatPanel** — message list with auto-scroll, input field that auto-detects
  dice notation (`NdN+M`). Last 100 messages loaded from DB on connect. Dice
  results persisted with structured JSON data. Messages styled with username in
  accent color and dice rolls in golden italic.
- **InitiativeTracker** — sorted initiative list showing value, portrait icon,
  and name per entry. "+" button for manual entry, "Next Turn" to advance.
  Lock/unlock toggle (GM) prevents character sheet initiative rolls when locked.
  Characters and creatures can roll initiative from their respective panels
  (d20 + DEX modifier + initiative bonus for D&D 5e), which automatically adds
  them to the tracker sorted by value. Rolls also appear in the chat log.
- **InventoryPanel** — item list with quantity controls, add/remove.
- **CharacterSheet** — template-driven character sheet editor. Fields are
  grouped by category and rendered by type (number, text, checkbox, textarea).
  Includes resource tracking bars (HP, spell slots) with +/- buttons and undo.
  "Roll Initiative" button between resource bars and ability scores (disabled
  when initiative is locked). Character field edits are sent as
  `UpdateCharacterField` WebSocket messages for real-time sync. The Character
  Selection list uses a composite `<For>` key that includes portrait, data,
  and resources so that any change (portrait, HP, stats) triggers a re-render.
  Supports character portraits via the media browser.
- **CreaturePanel** — GM-only creature stat block CRUD. Create, edit, and
  delete creature stat blocks with template-driven stat fields. "Roll
  Initiative" button on each creature card (always enabled, ignores lock).
  Creature stat blocks are linked to tokens for HP auto-initialization.

- **MediaBrowser** — modal dialog for browsing, searching, and uploading media
  files. Supports image thumbnails, tag-based filtering with autocomplete, and
  text search. Used by map background picker, token image picker, and character
  portrait picker.

### Multi-Window UI

The game page uses a windowed interface where each feature lives in its own
draggable, resizable window (`components/window_manager.rs`). The
`WindowManager` component wraps the game viewport and renders `GameWindow`
children. Each window has a title bar (drag handle, minimize/close buttons),
resizable edges/corners, and z-index stacking (click to front). Minimized
windows dock to a taskbar at the bottom. A toolbar in the game header toggles
window visibility. Window layout is persisted to `localStorage`.

Default windows: Map (large, center), Chat (right), Character Sheet, Initiative,
Inventory (minimized), Creatures (GM only).

### Media Storage

Media files (images and audio) use content-addressable storage (CAS). Files are
stored on disk by SHA-256 hash under `uploads/media/` (configurable via
`MEDIA_DIR` env var), sharded by first two hex characters. Upload via multipart
POST to `/api/media/upload` (JWT auth from cookie, 20 MB limit). Serve via
`GET /api/media/:hash` with immutable cache headers. Supported types: PNG, JPG,
GIF, WebP (images), WAV, MP3 (audio). Tags are stored in the `media_tags` table;
the original filename is automatically added as a tag on upload.

## CI / CD

### Pull Requests

Every PR targeting `main` runs four parallel jobs:

| Job | What it does |
|-----|-------------|
| **Compile & Test** | Diesel migrations on a fresh DB, `cargo check` for both SSR and hydrate targets, `cargo test` |
| **Formatting** | `cargo fmt --check` |
| **Clippy** | `cargo clippy` for both SSR and hydrate targets with `-D warnings` |
| **Smoke Test** | Full cargo-leptos build, then `ci/smoke-test-server.sh` (starts server, exercises all endpoints) |

All four jobs must pass before a PR can be merged.

### Releases

Pushing a tag matching `v*` (e.g. `v0.2.0`) to `main` triggers the release
workflow:

1. **Test** — same checks as the PR workflow (migrations, compile, unit tests)
2. **Build** — `cargo leptos build --release`, packages server binary + site
   assets + migrations into a tarball
3. **Smoke Test** — runs the smoke test suite against a debug build
4. **Publish** — creates a GitHub Release with auto-generated release notes and
   attaches the tarball

### CI Scripts

The `ci/` directory contains the test scripts used by both workflows:

- `ci/check-compile.sh` — checks both SSR and hydrate targets compile without
  warnings, runs `cargo test`
- `ci/check-migrations.sh` — applies migrations to a fresh SQLite database,
  verifies all expected tables and columns exist, tests rollback/redo
- `ci/smoke-test-server.sh` — builds and starts the server, then exercises page
  routes, CSS serving, signup, session CRUD, WebSocket endpoint, media
  upload/serve/dedup/tags, invalid input handling, and game page rendering (26
  checks)

## Deployment

### Building a Release Tarball

```sh
scripts/build-release.sh
```

This builds the server as a fully static musl binary (no glibc dependency) and
packages it with site assets and Diesel migrations into
`target/webrpg-<version>.tar.gz`. The resulting binary runs on any x86_64 Linux
regardless of the host's libc version.

Requires musl toolchain (see [Build Prerequisites](#build-prerequisites)).

### Deploying to a Remote Server

```sh
scripts/deploy.sh user@host [tarball]
```

If no tarball is specified, the script auto-detects the latest one in `target/`.
It uploads the tarball via SCP, unpacks it into `~/webrpg/<release>/`, and
creates a `current` symlink pointing to the new release. The `.env` file,
`database.db`, and `uploads/` directory are kept at `~/webrpg/` and symlinked
into the release, so they persist across deploys.

**First deploy:**

1. Run `scripts/build-release.sh` locally
2. Run `scripts/deploy.sh user@host`
3. SSH in and copy `~/webrpg/current/env.example` to `~/webrpg/.env`, edit it
4. Install Diesel CLI on the server and run `cd ~/webrpg/current && diesel migration run`
5. Start the server: `cd ~/webrpg/current && ./webrpg`

**Subsequent deploys:**

1. Run `scripts/build-release.sh`
2. Run `scripts/deploy.sh user@host`
3. Restart the server

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are tracked as individual files in `doc/feature-requests/`. Each
file contains the feature description, current progress, and status. This
replaces any global planning document.

**Workflow:**

1. Create a file in `doc/feature-requests/` describing the feature
2. Update progress and status in the file as work proceeds
3. When the feature is complete, include the feature request content in the git
   commit message and delete the feature request file

## Contributing

### Getting Started

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Follow the setup steps in [README.md](README.md)
3. Create a feature branch from `main`
4. Make your changes, keeping commits focused and well-described
5. Open a PR against `main`

### Code Standards

- **Both targets must compile cleanly.** Run both checks before pushing:
  ```sh
  cargo check --features ssr
  cargo check --features hydrate --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
  ```
- **No warnings.** CI runs with `-D warnings` on clippy. Fix all warnings
  before submitting.
- **Format with rustfmt.** Run `cargo fmt` before committing. CI enforces this.
- **Run tests.** `cargo test` must pass. Add tests for new server-side logic
  when practical.
- **Feature-gate correctly.** Server-only code behind `#[cfg(feature = "ssr")]`,
  client-only code behind `#[cfg(feature = "hydrate")]`. Imports used only
  inside `#[server]` function bodies go inside the function.

### PR Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single change. Large features should be broken into
  reviewable chunks.
- Write a clear description of what the PR does and why.
- If the PR changes the database schema, include a migration with both `up.sql`
  and `down.sql`. The `down.sql` must actually undo the change (not be a no-op).
- If the PR adds new endpoints or server functions, add corresponding checks to
  the smoke test script.
- Update `DEV.md` if the change affects architecture, build steps, or
  configuration.
- All CI checks must pass before merge.

### Commit Messages

Use concise, imperative-mood commit messages that describe the change:

```
Add media upload endpoint with SHA-256 dedup
Fix token HP popup not closing on click outside
Update initiative tracker to highlight current turn
```

### RPG Template System

Templates define the fields available on character sheets and creature stat
blocks via a JSON schema of `TemplateField` entries. Each field has a name,
label, type (`number`, `text`, `boolean`, `textarea`), category, and default
value. A default D&D 5e template is provided via the `seed_default_template`
server function (idempotent). Sessions can be assigned a template; characters
created in that session are initialized with the template's defaults.
